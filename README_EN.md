[h1]mod info[/h1]

Added a new character Aijo Karen, including 75 cards, 13 relics, and 3 potions.

[h1]Mechanism introduction[/h1]

The promise she made with her childhood friend Kagura Hikari was the original motivation for Karen to become a stage girl, so Karen has a unique deck - the [b]Promise Pile[/b]. The [b]Promise Pile[/b] can be used to store cards and schedule cards.

Every stage girl has shine, but shine is not something that can be obtained simply. Cards with the [b]Shine[/b] keyword are more powerful than ordinary cards, but will be permanently removed from the deck after being used a certain number of times. Select Shine cards at the right time to deal with various situations!

[h1]Acknowledgments[/h1]

Finally, it is currently under balance testing, and you are welcome to try it out and make suggestions.
